## FUNCTIONS ASSIGNMENT

### 1. QUESTION 1
* i. Write a function called int_return that takes an integer as input and returns
the same integer.
* ii. Write a function called add that takes any number as its input and returns
that sum with 2 added.
* iii. Write a function called greet that takes any name (string), and greets the
person. E.g. “Hello Bob! Nice to meet you!” (Only returns the greeting string,
printing is done in the main program.)
iv. Write a function, accum, that takes a list of integers as input and returns the
sum of those integers.
v. Write a function, length, that takes in a list as the input. If the length of the
list is greater than or equal to 5, return “Longer than 5”. If the length is less
than 5, return “Less than 5”.
vi. You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function,
divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2.
The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and
add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide function
within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals.

### 2. QUESTION 2
i. Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input
to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and
time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put
the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called
computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function
should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the
program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string
and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error
checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types
numbers properly.

### 3. QUESTION 3
i. Write a function sphere_volume that calculates and returns the volume of a
sphere when given radius r as a parameter.
ii. Then write a main program that calls sphere_volume to print the volume of
a sphere with a radius of 3.
iii. Write a function sphere that calls two other functions that calculate the area
of a circle sphere_area and volume of a sphere sphere_volume for a given
radius r as a parameter. Functions sphere_area and sphere_volume are
nested inside the function sphere. Function sphere returns both the area
and the volume of the sphere.
(Reproduce sphere_volume function inside function sphere.)
Make sure to print the results.
Formula to calculate the area of a circle: 𝑨 = 𝝅𝒓𝟐
Formula to calculate the volume of a circle: 𝑽 = 𝟒/𝟑 𝝅𝒓𝟑

### 4. QUESTION 4
i. Write a recursive function sum_of_numbers to calculate the sum of
numbers within a given range that takes start and end as parameters. The
function should work whether start is less or greater than end.
ii. Write a function called input to ask the user to enter the starting and ending
numbers and call sum_of_numbers with those arguments and prints the result.
iii. Write the same function sum_of_numbers to calculate the sum of numbers but
this time it takes a list of integers as an argument and calculates the sum of the
integers in the list. Invoke the function in the main program.
